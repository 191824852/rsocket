## Introduction

Key words used by this document conform to the meanings in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

## Terminology

* __Frame__: A frame of data containing a request or a response.
* __Transport__: Protocol used to carry ReactiveSockets protocol. Such as WebSockets, TCP, Aeron, etc.
* __Stream__: Unit of operation (request/response, etc.). See [Design Principles](DesignPrinciples.md).
* __Request__: A stream request. May be one of four types. As well as request for more items or cancellation of previous request.
* __Response__: A stream response. Contains data associated with previous request.
* __Client__: The side connecting to a server. i.e. initiating a connection.
* __Server__: The side accepting connections from clients.
* __Connection__: The instance of a transport session between client and server.
* __Requester__: The side sending a request. A connection has at most 2 Requesters. One in each direction.
* __Responder__: The side receiving a request. A connection has at most 2 Responders. One in each direction.

## Operation

### Frame Header Format

ReactiveSocket frames begin with a header. The general layout is given below. When used over
transport protocols that provide framing (WebSocket and Aeron), the Frame Length field is not included.
For transports that do not provide framing, such as TCP, the Frame Length MUST be included.

```

    +---------------------------------------------------------------+
                           Depends on Frame Type
```

* __Frame Length__: (31 = max 2,147,483,647 bytes) Length of Frame. Including header. Only used for TCP.
* __Version__: (8) Current version is 0.
* __Flags__:
     * (__I__)gnore: Ignore frame if not understood
* __Frame Type__: (16) Type of Frame.
* __Stream ID__: (64) Stream Identifier for this frame.

### Stream Identifiers

#### Generation

Stream IDs are generated by a Requester. The lifetime of a Stream ID is determined by the request type and
the semantics of the stream based on its type.

Stream ID value of 0 is reserved for any operation involving the connection.

A stream ID must be locally unique for a Requester in a connection.

### Frame Types

|  Type                          | Value  | Description |
|:-------------------------------|:-------|:------------|
| __RESERVED__                   | 0x0000 | __Reserved__ |
| __SETUP__                      | 0x0001 | __Setup__: Capabilities Of Side Sending The Frame. |
| __REQUEST_RESPONSE__           | 0x0011 | __Request Response__: |
| __REQUEST_FNF__                | 0x0012 | __Fire And Forget__: |
| __REQUEST_STREAM__             | 0x0013 | __Request Stream__: |
| __REQUEST_SUB__                | 0x0014 | __Request Subscription__: |
| __REQUEST_N__                  | 0x0015 | __Request N__: Request N more items |
| __CANCEL__                     | 0x0016 | __Cancel Request__: |
| __RESPONSE__                   | 0x0020 | __Response__: Response to a request. |
| __ERROR__                      | 0x0021 | __Error__: Response that is an error. |
| __EXT__                        | 0xFFFF | __Extension Header__: Used To Extend More Options As Well As Extensions. |

__NOTE__: In general Requesters send types 0x0010 to 0x001F and Responders send types 0x0020 to 0x002F.

### Setup Frame

Setup headers must always use Stream ID 0 as they pertain to the connection.

* __Error Data__: error information.

An ERROR frame is used for dual purposes:
* As a means for a server to reject a SETUP frame.
* As a means of communicating a stream ERROR from a Responder to a Requester.

### Extension Frame

```
     0                   1                   2                   3

    +---------------+-+-------------+-------------------------------+
    |    Version    |I|   Flags     |     Frame Type = EXT          |
    +---------------+-+-------------+-------------------------------+
    |                        Extended Type                          |
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+
                          Depends on Extended Type...
```

* __Frame Type__: (16) 0xFFFF for Extension Header.
* __Flags__:
    * (__I__)gnore: Can be ignored.
* __Extended Type__: Extended type information

## Connection Establishment

__NOTE__: The semantics are similar to [TLS False Start](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-bmoeller-tls-falsestart-00).

Immediately upon successful connection, the client MUST send a SETUP frame with
Stream ID of 0. The client-side Requester may send requests immediately if it so desires without waiting for
a response from the server.

If the server accepts the contents of the SETUP frame, it does nothing special. The server-side Requester may send requests immediately
upon receiving a SETUP frame that it accepts.

If the server does NOT accept the contents of the SETUP frame, the server MUST send back an ERROR on Stream ID 0
and then close the connection.

A client assumes a SETUP is accepted if it receives a response to a request or if it sees a REQUEST type.

A client assumes a SETUP is rejected if it receives an ERROR with stream ID 0. 

### Negotiation

The assumption is that the client will be dictating to the server what it desires to do. The server will decide to support
that SETUP (accept it) or not (reject it).

### Sequences

1. Client-side Request, Server-side __accepts__ SETUP
    * Client connects & sends SETUP & sends REQUEST
    * Server accepts SETUP, handles REQUEST, sends back normal sequence based on REQUEST type
1. Client-side Request, Server-side __rejects__ SETUP
    * Client connects & sends SETUP & sends REQUEST
    * Server rejects SETUP, sends back ERROR stream ID 0, closes connection
1. Server-side Request, Server-side __accepts__ SETUP
    * Client connects & sends SETUP
    * Server accepts SETUP, sends back REQUEST type
1. Server-side Request, Server-side __rejects__ SETUP
    * Client connects & sends SETUP
    * Server rejects SETUP, sends back ERROR stream ID 0, closes connection

## Fragmentation And Reassembly

RESPONSE frames may respresent a large object and MAY need to be fragmented to fit within the Frame Data size. When this
occurs, the RESPONSE Begin and End bits must be used to indicate a begin fragment and an end fragment. Or, when
both bits set, the contents represent a reassembled RESPONSE.

## Stream Sequences and Lifetimes

In the section below, "RQ -> RS" refers to Requester sending a frame to a Responder. And "RS -> RQ" refers to Responder sending
a frame to a Requester.

In the section below, "*" refers to 0 or more and "+" refers to 1 or more.

### Request Response

1. RQ -> RS: REQUEST_RESPONSE
1. RS -> RQ: RESPONSE with COMPLETE

or

1. RQ -> RS: REQUEST_RESPONSE
1. RS -> RQ: ERROR

or

1. RQ -> RS: REQUEST_RESPONSE
1. RQ -> RS: CANCEL

Upon sending a response, the stream is terminated on the Responder.

Upon receiving a CANCEL, the stream is terminated on the Responder and the response should not be sent.

Upon sending a CANCEL, the stream is terminated on the Requester.

Upon receiving a COMPLETE or ERROR, the stream is terminated on the Requester.

### Request Fire-n-Forget

1. RQ -> RS: REQUEST_FNF

Upon reception, the stream is terminated by the Responder.

Upon being sent, the stream is terminated by the Requester.

REQUEST_FNF are assumed to be best effort and MAY not be processed due to: (1) SETUP rejection, (2) mis-formatting, (3) etc.

### Request Stream

1. RQ -> RS: REQUEST_STREAM
1. RS -> RQ: RESPONSE*
1. RS -> RQ: ERROR

or

1. RQ -> RS: REQUEST_STREAM
1. RS -> RQ: RESPONSE*
1. RS -> RQ: RESPONSE with COMPLETE

or 

1. RQ -> RS: REQUEST_STREAM
1. RS -> RQ: RESPONSE*
1. RQ -> RS: CANCEL

At any time, a client may send REQUEST_N frames.

Upon receiving a CANCEL, the stream is terminated on the Responder.

Upon sending a CANCEL, the stream is terminated on the Requester.

Upon receiving a COMPLETE or ERROR, the stream is terminated on the Requester.

Upon sending a COMPLETE or ERROR, the stream is terminated on the Responder.

### Request Subscription

1. RQ -> RS: REQUEST_SUBSCRIPTION
1. RS -> RQ: RESPONSE*

or

1. RQ -> RS: REQUEST_SUBSCRIPTION
1. RS -> RQ: RESPONSE*
1. RS -> RQ: ERROR

or

1. RQ -> RS: REQUEST_SUBSCRIPTION
1. RS -> RQ: RESPONSE*
1. RQ -> RS: CANCEL

At any time, a client may send REQUEST_N frames.

Upon receiving a CANCEL, the stream is terminated on the Responder.

Upon sending a CANCEL, the stream is terminated on the Requester.

Upon receiving a ERROR, the stream is terminated on the Requester.

Upon sending a ERROR, the stream is terminated on the Responder.

### Per Stream State

#### Requester

1. CLOSED: implicit starting/ending state of all stream IDs
1. Requested (sent REQUEST_*)
1. CLOSED (received COMPLETE or sent REQUEST_FNF)
1. CLOSED (received ERROR)

#### Responder

1. CLOSED: implicit starting/ending state of all stream IDs
1. Responding: sending RESPONSEs and processing REQUEST_N
1. CLOSED (received CANCEL)
1. CLOSED (sent COMPLETE or received REQUEST_FNF)
1. CLOSED (sent ERROR)

#### Handling the Unexpected

* Recieving a header in a state that is not specified means it is ignored (or causes termination?)
* Should StreamIDs be timedout after inactivity?
    * if so, need keepalive semantics

### ChangeLog

1. Removed usage of header chains to discourage frames from being too large.

### TODO

- [ ] REQUEST_N needs to return point in stream in some way. Or even a new header type REQUEST_N_POSITIONED, or POSITION header, e.g.
    * object (NEXT) counter (and/or RESPONSE byte counter) kept as Requester stat for the stream
    * without the point in the stream, the window location is unclear and can lead to over-saturation of a subscriber
- [ ] Need request throttling and back pressure semantics. A new Requester may need to be controlled as to how many requests it can send. Also,
it is probably necessary to throttle the amount of outstanding request a Requester can have outstanding. As well as make a Requester stop generating
new requests on command.
    * request throttling is a separation of concerns from flow control of a single stream/subscription
- [ ] Stream ID should maybe be renamed to Request ID.
- [ ] naming
    - Connection instance
        * Requester instance
        * Responder instance
- [ ] Exlicit METADATA needed as mentioned in #3
    * need to understand metadata semantics
    * could be flag or explicit frame type or if needed to be attached to specific NEXT, could be option header
- [ ] Handling the unexpected questions
- [ ] Can replace BE bits with a single __M__ore bit that indicates more fragments follow the current fragment
